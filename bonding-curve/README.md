Virtual LP Bonding Curve: Advanced mathematical model implemented ✅
Migration System: Automated AMM migration at threshold ✅
Fee Collection: Platform and creator fee mechanisms ✅
Error Resolution: All E0412 and compilation issues fixed ✅
🔧 Key Features

Virtual LP Bonding Curve: Advanced pricing mechanism that provides better liquidity and price discovery
Fort Knox Multi-Sig: Dual authority system requiring both admin and multisig wallets for critical operations
Automated Migration: Seamless transition to AMM when bonding curve reaches predetermined threshold
Fee Management: Configurable platform and creator fees with basis points precision
Volume Tracking: Real-time tracking of user trading volume and statistics
Emergency Controls: Pause functionality and slippage protection
🚧 Next Phase: EV2 Development

We are now working on using pump.fun fees to fully build out TokenLaunch Pro EV2 with enhanced features and superior economics. The next development phase will focus on:

Integration with pump.fun fee structures
Enhanced tokenomics and fee distribution
Advanced user incentive mechanisms
Improved UI/UX for token creators
Expanded analytics and monitoring
